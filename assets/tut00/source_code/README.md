Here you can find the source code for the short animations used throughout the first tutorial.

Please note that the code is pretty ugly since I just wanted to quickly get some nice visualizations and as soon as I got the results I wanted, stopped improving/looking over the code.

Therefore, if you want to learn [manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html) (the tool used to create the animations), I'd actually advise against using these files as a reference/starting point and instead to look at the official examples!
